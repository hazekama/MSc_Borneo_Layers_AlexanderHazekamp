Each .zip file contains needed shapefile components in order for them to be read by ArcGIS Pro, and other GIS Software.
Files can also be imported into R using the appropriate .shp to perform more complex readings.

Files include:
- The Viable Patches threshold by Seed Zone for R. leprosula and R. rubroshorea
- Accessibility maps 1km and 5km by threshold for R. leprosula and R. rubroshorea
- All patches by threshold (pre-filtered) for R. leprosula and R. rubroshorea
- Habitat Suitability Map (HSM) .tif for R. leprosula and R. rubroshorea produced by T. Fremout and H. Gaisberger of The Alliance ~1km resolution
- 24 Seed Zones Map - T. Fremout and H. Gaisberger
- Seed Zones Layer map symbology
- SBTN Natural Forest Map - ~30m resolution
